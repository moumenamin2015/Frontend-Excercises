These are some static pages I have practiced on during my journey of learning CSS. 

Here I was foucsing on the different CSS topcis like positioning, selectors, psuedo elements, ..etc

I have done some challenges from http://frontendmentor.com which was pretty amazing and helped me so much to apply what I have learned.
